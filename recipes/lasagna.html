<p> this is tasty lasgna, i made myslefFor many of us, fall means the return of routine, cooler temperatures, and harvesting the last of summer's bounty. It's also the time of year when ingredients like squash, potatoes, and root vegetables are at their very finest. Combine that with the seasonal chill in the air, and cranking up the oven suddenly feels like a good decision for the first time in months. Here are some of our favorite sheet pan suppers that take advantage of autumn's flavors and are easy enough for the hectic back-to-school season. They're fast and nearly effortless, and clean-up is a breeze. All of these recipes are simple enough to throw together on a weeknight so you can savor all the season has to offerâ€”both in and out of the kitchen.
